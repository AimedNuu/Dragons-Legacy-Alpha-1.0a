# [Dragons Legacy Alpha 1.0a]

This is a complete code from ServUO latest Repo Dated Dec. 13th 2016, I have also went and added in the .Net 4.6.1 Framework support.

All rights to the Original Code will be left in tacked, All modifications have been done by myself with the help of scripts i have found on ServUO as well as other sites, But have been fixed to work properly with the Latest Repo of ServUO.

Use at own Risk... If you fix/change bugs please post them

Thank you
